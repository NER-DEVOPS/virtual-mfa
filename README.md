Virtual MFA
===========

Implementation of the [Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (TOTP) in Perl.  This script can be used as a virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device for sites like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/) and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

This utility can either be used as a primary virtual MFA device or a potential backup for smartphone apps like Google Authenticator.

Requirements
------------

  * Linux/Unix system with Perl installed
  * Perl *Digest::SHA* and *IO::Select* modules (typically part of core Perl).

Optional requirements, though highly recommended to avoid leaving your shared secrets out in the open, include [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) and a personal key pair.

Intended Usage
--------------

While you're welcome to edit `virtual-mfa.pl` and hard-code your MFA secret, storing the script _with secrets included_ in cleartext is a __bad idea__.  To avoid leaving your MFA shared secrets out in the open on your local filesystem, I ___strongly___ advise encrypting the script with something like [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/).

Included in this repository is a helper script `generate_mfa.sh` that can generate a self-executing script that is encrypted with `gpg`.

For those who want to handle encryption/encoding on their own, something like the following should suffice as an example (adjusting command paths accordingly):

```
cat <<\EOF > OUTPUT_FILENAME
#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/gpg -d $0 | /usr/bin/perl
exit

\EOF

cat virtual-mfa.pl | \
  sed 's/DEPOSIT_SECRET_HERE/YOUR_SECRET/' | \
  gpg [--default-key KEY] --armor -ser RECIPIENT >> OUTPUT_FILENAME
chmod 700 OUTPUT_FILENAME
```
